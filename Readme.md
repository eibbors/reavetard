# Reavetard

  Enhancements for Reaver-WPS PIN cracker, including support for multiple target AP rotation, extra annotations / colored output for both reaver and wash, plus some much needed database and session file utilities.

## About her

  Reavetard is a pet project that evolved out of some small shell scripts I made to correct some annoying parts of the Reaver WPS workflow. It will be under heavy construction for a week or two while I finalize the more complicated reaver automation. It can, however, already be used to provide prettier wash output with all of the juicy goodness from Reaver's sqlite database and sessions thrown into the mix. 

  The name is a subtle, yet striking, eloquently sophisticated play on the words Reaver and Retard that simply rolls off the tongue as if it were butter on a steaming pile of fresh human feces. It's the kind of project title you can feel comfortable bringing home to meet Meema and Psopop.

## Installation

  $ npm install reavetard

  Currently only designed to run/tested on Backtrack 5 R2, but it should work on any Linux system supported by reaver. I'm happy to help out, if you're having trouble installing her.
